I'm a veteran in the area of supply chain management software. 

My expertise and interests are at the intersection of:
- business processes for planning
- software development
- data integration
Never a dull moment in that domain.

Oh, and don't take away my music :musical_note: and my bike :bike:.<br />
You can also ask me anything about home brewing :beer:. I'm Belgian and we love our beers.
