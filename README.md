I'm a veteran in the area of supply chain management software. 

My expertise and interests are at the intersection of:
- business processes for planning
- software development
- data integration
Never a dull moment in that domain.

Check out [my linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johan-de-taeye-18455/) to find where I got all those scars and lost my hair. :sweat:

Oh, and don't take away my music :musical_note: and my bike :bike:. I need both to feel well.

You can also ask me anything about home brewing. I'm Belgian and love my beers.
